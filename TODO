* STARTED [#A] Add fileServe
  :LOGBOOK:
  - State "STARTED"    from "TODO"       [2010-04-14 Wed 22:55]
  - Note taken on [2010-04-13 Tue 18:36] \\
    Executive decision: defer directory indices for another version

    fileServe :: FilePath -> Snap ()
    fileServe' :: MimeMap -> FilePath -> Snap ()
    
     - Files served relative to root dir + rqPathInfo
    
     - check and prohibit ".." outside of root dir
    
     - mime map done by extension, or by suffix? e.g. ".tar.gz"?
       - search efficiency -- reverse the filename and lookup in a trie?

* TODO [#A] Finish HTTP server test suite

* TODO [#A] Review HTTP server code for exception safety

* TODO [#B] GIT submodule setup for the various snap-* libraries

* TODO [#B] Better benchmarks
  :LOGBOOK:
  - Note taken on [2010-04-13 Tue 02:50] \\
    Ways to make the benchmarks better:
    
     - fine-grained microbenchmarks w/ criterion
    
     - track benchmark progress over time (using Hudson or the 'progression'
       package)
    
     - more sophistication than just "PONG"
    
       - test performance for larger streams with/without compression, etc
  :END:

* TODO [#C] Setup a CI server, either buildbot or hudson
  :LOGBOOK:
  - Note taken on [2010-04-13 Tue 02:51] \\
    Buildbot should track:
    
     - warnings/errors/build status
    
     - test coverage report, test suite success rate over time
    
     - benchmarks over time
